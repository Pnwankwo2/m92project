# Module 9 First project
# Team Members: Patrick Nwankwo, Jesse Poljak, Larry Azar.
# Our team is going to analyze the United States daily nominal exchange 
# rate from years 1996 to 2024.
# The date source is the following: Bank for International Settlements 
# (2024), Effective exchange rates, BIS WS_EER 1.0 (data set), 
https:// data.bis.org/topics/EER/BIS,WS_EER,1.0/D.N.B.US (accessed on 24 September 2024).
# Columns include the daily time period, exchange rate nominal value.
# The Unit column has a an index, 2020 = 100 as the base year.
# There is a column for the value of the basket of currencies for 64 
# economies against which the US Dollar is measured. 
# Null values will be dropped, for e.g. for public holidays & weekends. 
# Static columns will be dropped.
# The data can be analyzed by doing a profit model of how this nominal 
# value is actually modelled to identify changes and how those changes may have been affected 
# or not affected by the US Presidential election as a seasonality impact.
# We are going to compare measurement of central tendency and variability between the 
# election and non-election years.
